This application should load all the calendar files pasted in calendar_files (.ics) and then parse them and display the current day timetable on the display.

Also, it should switch regularly with a loaded webpage of public transport timetables and also switch with .png image files (or perhaps .pptx?) slides regularly.

It should also ideally work when these files are swapped without the need to restart the app.
